Content of "data" sub-directory

Data is sorted by catchments.

For each catchment you can find:
- the shapefile of the watershed of the small catchment
- the shapefile of the river network
- a reach.par file (to open in a text editor) : this file can be useful to know the connections between the reaches. The "ID" columns refers to the reaches identifier, and "to-reach" indicates the ID of the reach in which it flows. Please use this file in priority to work with the reaches and use the shapefile to plot the results spatially.
- a csv table with the reach IDs of the Drver's samplig sites
